## Dovecot configuration file

# Dovecot configuration version. This must be the first setting in the
# configuration file. It specifies the configuration syntax, the used setting
# names and the expected default values.
dovecot_config_version = @DOVECOT_CONFIG_VERSION@

# Dovecot storage file format version. It specifies the oldest Dovecot version
# that must be able to read files written by this Dovecot instance. The
# intention is that when upgrading Dovecot cluster, this setting is first kept
# as the old Dovecot version. Once the cluster is fully upgraded to a new
# version and there is no intention to rollback to the old version anymore,
# this version number can be increased.
